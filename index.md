        Perihelion is run by <a href="https://willgdjones.com">Will Jones</a>, formerly CTO and cofounder of <a href="https://sanogenetics.com">Sano Genetics</a>. After 7 years building a 20-strong engineering team in healthtech, I now help companies build AI-powered products and internal tools at speed.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
        I work with startups, scale-ups and enterprise teams across fintech, healthtech and SaaS. If you can describe what you need, I can probably build it faster than you'd expect.
